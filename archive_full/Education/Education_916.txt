theories arrived inductive reasoning rather deductive reasoning within strict framework logic ideas must referred theories would seem simple enough yet confusion meaning word since public even astrophysicists often use word theory using word hypothesis determines scientific idea model hypothesis theory analogy solving board puzzle helpful clarifying distinction theory hypothesis may several puzzle pieces could possible candidates fill open space puzzle puzzle pieces would considered possible hypotheses trying puzzle pieces one pieces may appear fit one sides puzzle point may tempting upgrade status puzzle piece good hypothesis theory actually puzzle piece still hypothesis caution needed evidence comes case board puzzle pieces fit around occasionally piece thought fit one side match another side hypothesis must rejected piece proves fitting least two three sides confident piece fits puzzle way multiple distinct logical arguments based factual evidence upgrade hypothesis status called theory finally similar board puzzle piece correct theory fits base knowledge much seem fit surrounding evidence whereas hypothesis seems fit facts theory allows us see big picture make sense evidence surrounds theories important ideas science allow us see significance random information wrong sherlock holmes type deductive reasoning statement possible hypotheses eliminated except one hypothesis matter unlikely correct hypothesis deductive reasoning draws conclusions complete certainty tempting sometimes believe using deductive reasoning fact using inductive reasoning fictional sherlock holmes makes mistake rarely ever reasoning concerning nature considered deductive reasoning problem implies possible hypothesis identified fact may never know natures secrets important conduct experiments collect field data verify logic experiments often learn natures secrets added base knowledge even though inductive reasoning draw conclusions complete certainty generally much helpful deductive reasoning inductive reasoning allows us reach conclusions directly observed based observed inductive reasoning allows geologists use present observations draw conclusions events happened million years ago earths distant past often inductive reasoning allows us use observation past anticipate probable events future example every day bus stops bench pm sitting bench minutes four would expecting bus arrive within minutes notice inductive reasoning may correct vast majority times still guaranteed always true matter consistent bus may say complete certainty bus day predicted time attempting solve problem would like consider reasonable hypotheses believe identify possibilities often equivalent stating limited imagination scientific theories arrived inductive reasoning true never proven well yes following strict rules logic one could claim matter many arguments appear confirm theory technically still possibility wrong however realistic terms several sound arguments lead agreement conceptual model odds theory wrong become extremely small practical purposes answer referring board puzzle example let us say piece appeared fit one side matched second side three finally four sides fit puzzle puzzle piece seamlessly fits puzzle isnt bit ridiculous continue arguing whether belongs often happen theory new evidence lead slight yet important modifications theory biologists test theory evolution know chances overturning theory evolution effectively nil scientists continue experiment hopes might gain deeper understanding evolution works example darwin favored called gradualism evolution suggesting birth new species came gradual separation original yet recent evidence shows far common new species evolve small isolated populations might later quickly displace larger populations punctuated equilibrium form evolution fossil evidence tends show abrupt changes species gradual separation would suggest modification darwins original idea certainly overthrow evolution theory rather important improvement understanding process works example scientific theory copernican heliocentric model solar system good example guidelines show scientific theory purpose providing simpler explanation movement planets nicolaus copernicus suggested sun rather earth center thought universe two many strong points copernican model gave logical explanation phases moon apparent retrograde motion mars seen earth yet like many scientific truths unsetting many people think earth center universe evidence needed could accepted point copernican model would considered strong hypothesis rather theory much later philosopher giordano bruno promoted merits throughout europe scientists galileo galilei johannes kepler provided additional evidence needed raise status idea theory kepler used precise data another astronomer tycho brahe discover planets move ellipse sun focus powerful argument sun rather earth center galileos contributions came constructing one first telescopes using new technology record observations telescope observed mountains surface moon additional moons orbiting jupiter phases venus sunspots sun presented observations supported heliocentric model solar system publication dialogue concerning two chief world systems independently even collectively arguments based inductive reasoning prove sun center solar system taken collectively becomes effectively impossible arguments lead conclusion without correct conclusion argument like side puzzle piece argument might help disprove hypothesis fit mismatch one side puzzle piece ever argument supports conclusion becomes increasingly ridiculous argue conclusion correct hypothesis passes test classified scientific theory several strong independent arguments based sound evidence supporting conclusion theory evolution true scientific theory theory evolution true scientific theory passes test several independent arguments based evidence leading conclusion furthermore theory evolution demonstrated ability powerful tool making sense evidence surrounds theory evolution proven one important scientific theories theory evolution true scientific theory still controversy almost everyone believes open new ideas yet reality many people unwilling adjust fundamental beliefs many people see theory evolution affront belief human beings uniquely gifted apart species planet however scientific evidence supporting belief endowed ancestral lineage separate species truth upsets many people would rather ignore overwhelming evidence give belief closing minds overwhelming evidence envision theory evolution hypothesis might remain hope defeated attacking evolution often times distorting truth intention promote better science instead fulfill wishful agenda constructive criticism welcome us seek improvement clear critics evolution promote antiscience philosophy damaging success civilization good science seeks truth reality regardless makes us feel however human nature selfcentered willing listen make us feel important even scientists human sometimes upset truths discover successful interacting reality need show maturity accepting truth center universe earth six thousand years old human beings uniquely created species general rule helpful determining truth argument placing us center attention likely deceiving us playing human need feel important almost certain wrong fighting human weakness show maturity better able make wise decisions return home page please send email questions comments material copyrighted please properly cite dinosaurtheorycom
